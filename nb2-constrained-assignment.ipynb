    "*Purpose*: Many engineering problems have constraints, whether those are the laws of physics, safety considerations, or legal requirements. Constraints greatly complicate optimization, both in the analysis of optimality conditions and in the practical design of algorithms. In this assignment you'll get some practice solving constrained optimization problems, and applying these tools to support *materials selection*.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Learning Objectives*:\n",
    "- use Pandas to work with data\n",
    "- learn and apply the KKT conditions for constrained optimality\n",
    "- use `gr.ev_min()` for constrained optimization problems\n",
    "- use the KKT conditions to derive materials indices\n",
    "- use materials indices to do materials selection\n",
